# UserScripts

## Scope

This folder contains UserScripts, which are not part of the Application itself, but can be used during development, to ease up certain processes, like jumping to the couchdb associated with a certain task, for example.

## Usage

The UserScripts can be used in conjunction with a corresponding Browser extension, like [TamperMonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/).
